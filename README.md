# Uber-clone

Uber clone app was built with React Native &amp; Redux, and Google Auto-complete API as well as Google Metrix API. This app tries to mimic some core functionalities of the real app. It allows users to pick a starting point (pick-up point) and the destination. Once the origin & the destination are set, the app will navigate user to a new screen with the map, the markers & the path between two markers.
